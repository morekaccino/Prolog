# My thoughts on this course

It was not an easy course! Make sure you keep up with the class.<br>
I didn't read the textbook, but I fully understood all the slides.<br>
Workload is high! the assignments are brutal. mostly because there is no help on the internet about the subject.
I mean there is, but not as straightforward as other subjects (like database).
<br>
This course can be considered as an extension of MATH 1090. We basically coded everything we learned in that course using a very old (I mean it, my dad did his PhD with this) language called Prolog. and a little bit of Golog.<br>
If you didn't like MATH 1090, it is going to be hell.

Cheers
